# TODO list ( not exhaustive):

- Proper testing and bug checks (currently not tested thoroughly)
- CLAUDE.md not setup (currently after thought)- update it and use nested claude.md 
- Split index.js into modules ( currently very patchy)
- mac notification ( later slack or email notification )
- Remote deployment ( currently my 16gb m2 mac crashes after sometime)
- Replace hard coded with txt or some form of input 
- More human replication to not violate whatsapp web policies (risk of whatsapp blocking my number- currently living with this risk )
- auto fetching of new groups and changes in group names
- Fuzzy match logic( e.g. to account for typing errors)
- sqlLite or some small db for data persistence
- basic analytics
- Export functionality 
- proper logging
- make more interactive
- better error recovery
